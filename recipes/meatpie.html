    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Minced meat</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour into a bowl. Add chunks of cold butter. Use fingers to rub butter into flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until a non-sticky dough forms. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, add  meat, onions, garlic, and carrots, and cook, stirring constantly, until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add white pepper, curry powder, thyme, and mixed herbs, and mix well; cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Remove from heat; set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>On a well-floured surface, roll dough out about 1/4-inch thick, and cut out circles using a cookie cutter, cup, or bowl in a size you are happy with. Place some filling in the center of the pastry circle and fold over carefully. Press the edges of the pastry firmly together with a fork to seal. Re-roll dough scraps, and repeat until pastry and meat filling are used up.</li>
        <li>Place pies on the prepared baking sheet. Using a pastry brush, brush the formed pies with beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is hot, about 15 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
